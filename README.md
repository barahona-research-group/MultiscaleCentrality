Multiscale Centrality
=====================

Multiscale centrality (MSC) is a scale dependent measure of centrality on complex networks. 

Classic measures of graph centrality capture distinct aspects of node importance, from the local (e.g., degree) to the global (e.g., closeness). Here we exploit the connection between diffusion and geometry to introduce a multiscale centrality measure. A node is defined to be central if it breaks the metricity of the diffusion as a consequence of the effective boundaries and inhomogeneities in the graph. Our measure is naturally multiscale, as it is computed relative to graph neighborhoods within the varying time horizon of the diffusion. We find that the centrality of nodes can differ widely at different scales. In particular, our measure correlates with degree (i.e., hubs) at small scales and with closeness (i.e., bridges) at large scales, and also reveals the existence of multicentric structures in complex networks. By examining centrality across scales, our measure thus provides an evaluation of node importance relative to local and global processes on the network.


The code in this repository implements the MSC algorithm and contains a small pipeline to run examples on classic graphs.

## Installation

Required packages: numpy/scipy/matplotlib/networkx/forceatlas2 . 

To install, run in the main folder:

```python setup.py install```

## Tests

In the example folder, the script ``compute_multiscale_centrality.py`` can be used to run the benchmark examples in the paper:
```python compute_multiscale_centrality.py GRAPH_NAME```
where ``GRAPH_NAME`` could be:
* ``karate``
* ``celegans``
* ``delaunay``


Alternatively, the Multiscale Centrality can easily be adapted to be applied to other graphs - see the readme in the test folder.  

For a quick start, check out our [examples](https://github.com/barahona-research-group/MultiscaleCentrality/tree/master/test) in the `test/` directory.
